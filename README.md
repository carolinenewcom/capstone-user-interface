# capstone-user-interface
 This repository will house files related to the user interface of my DT Tracker web application.

 Purpose of the Application:
The purpose of the DT Tracker is to assist Developmental Therapists in tracking their attendance percentages for individual children on 
their caseload as well as their caseload as a whole. Funding for Developmental Therapy is contingent upon maintaining an attendance percentage rate of at or above seventy-five percent. The DT Tracker will make tracking attendance far more efficient. 

 The Role of this Project:
The user interface plays a significant role within the application. The user interface is what the user (Developmental Therapists) will interact with as they utilize the web application. This particular project is crucial as having a user interface that is simple to navigate, easy to understand, and visually pleasing is key for the overall success of the DT Tracker web application. The user interface will allow Developmental Therapists to view their caseload, their weekly schedule, input session information, and view charts that will display attendance percentages.
